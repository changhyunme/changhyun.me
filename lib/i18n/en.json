I believe good tools matter, but clear thinking matters more. Also, I probably spend too much time tweaking things no one else notices. And I'm fine with that. If something feels off, I'll refactor it. If something's confusing, I'll simplify it. If it needs to ship, I'll get it done. Simple as that.",
