As a developer and musician, I poured my love for creating into this project, blending the juicy plums of Goyang, Korea, with a touch of traditional Maesilju magic. The name ‘Miuju’ comes from my cat, Miu, whose curious eyes and endless inspiration (that’s the ‘uju,’ meaning universe in Korean) sparked this whole adventure. With fewer than 100 bottles made, each one holds a story of time, craft, and a whole lot of feeling."

      "content": "Picture this: it’s May 2024, and I’m out in the orchards of Goyang, picking the ripest, reddest plums under the spring sun. Every plum was hand-checked, gently washed, and air-dried to keep it perfect—like cleaning up code before a big commit. I mixed those plums with sugar and refined soju, stirring them together just right to let the flavors meld. Then, into glass jars they went, sealed up tight and ready for a year of quiet transformation."

      "content": "For 12 months, those jars sat in a cool, dark corner, letting time work its magic. No rushing, no shortcuts—just the slow, natural infusion of plum goodness into the soju. It’s like waiting for a long-running script to finish: you trust the process and let it unfold. The result? A liqueur that’s deep, smooth, and full of soul, with the plums’ tart sweetness shining through in every drop."

Her silhouette against the light felt like a tiny universe of ideas waiting to happen. That’s where ‘Miuju’ was born—Miu plus ‘uju,’ a nod to the endless inspiration she brings. As a developer, I’m always chasing those sparks, whether it’s a clever line of code or a new project like this. Miuju is my way of bottling that feeling, blending craft with creativity."

I collaborated with a handcrafted glass atelier in Goyang, where skilled artisans breathe life into molten glass, shaping each bottle with a mystical touch. These bottles, with their smooth curves and understated elegance, seem to glow with the quiet magic of traditional glasscraft. They’re not just containers—they’re vessels for Miuju’s story, designed to hold the essence of a fleeting moment."

Each one features a single, striking element: the silhouette of my cat, Miu, gazing out a window, etched in minimalist Korean typography. Printed on water-resistant paper, these labels are hand-applied, one by one, like perfecting the last pixel of a webpage. With only a handful of bottles crafted, each feels like a unique piece of art, whispering Miuju’s story of curiosity and craft."

Feeling fancy? Mix it with soda water and a squeeze of lime for a fizzy spritzer, or shake it with gin and a splash of elderflower for a cocktail that’s pure elegance. It’s the kind of drink that feels right whether you’re winding down or celebrating."

It’s also great straight up, with the plum’s zing front and center. Sip it after a meal, and it works like a charm to settle your stomach. A small glass before bed? You’ll drift off into the coziest sleep. Honestly, it’s like a magic potion—tummy aches, sore throats, you name it, Miuju seems to make it better. Call it my homemade cure-all!"
