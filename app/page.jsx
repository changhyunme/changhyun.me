    version: "v2.1",
    year: "Mid 2013",
    stack: "Apache + PHP / JS",
    desc: "I started to move away from jQuery, frustrated by its weight. This led me to manipulate the DOM directly with JavaScript. I learned it through Codecademy ‚Äî which was free at the time (not anymore in 2025).",

    desc: "I built a basic message board with comments using a MySQL backend. It was also my first attempt at responsive design with CSS media queries. I remember trying to create my own utility class system ‚Äî kind of a DIY Tailwind before Tailwind. Bootstrap was big back then, but I opted for a 12-column layout instead of Bootstrap's 10.

Instead of creating separate pages, I routed everything through index.php using GET parameters ‚Äî kind of an early, accidental version of MVC. That eventually got me curious about programming fundamentals like object-oriented design, algorithms, and data structures."

I kept putting off Tailwind for years, but I picked it up in about three days. Honestly? Should‚Äôve used it sooner. I considered other stacks like Astro, Vue, and Svelte, but after a few weeks of testing, React still felt the most stable and flexible. As long as I keep the domain, I‚Äôll probably keep this site alive for good.",

                It‚Äôs a place where I reflect on what I‚Äôve built ‚Äî and more importantly, why I built it.<br />
                Tech is just a tool. Direction and intention always come first.
              </p>

              <p>üõ†Ô∏è Lately, I‚Äôve been focused on full-stack JavaScript, performance tuning, and UX flow design.</p>
              <p>
                I run side projects regularly and rebuild things often, sometimes just to see if I can do it better.
